This `data_readme` file briefly describes the data used for the ARG Project. This structure helps maintain a clean and organized data repository, ensuring that data can be easily accessed, understood, and replicated.   
It is encouraged to always separate external data from code-generated data and to only commit data that cannot be regenerated. An exception could be made in cases where generating the data takes substantial time and the resulting dataset is relatively small.

These directories are organized as follows:
- external: Store data obtained from outside the repo that cannot be regenerated by the code contained within the repo. These data should be committed. If your external data is too large, consider storing it in a database or an external data repository. GitHub LFS might also be an alternative. The data stored in the external repository should always be accompanied by a data codebook.
> [!NOTE]
> This folder remains empty for this project, as no external data is directly uploaded. Instead, data is pulled from WRDS into the `data/pulled` folder and then prepared (filtered) into the `data/generated` folder.

- pulled: This is where data pulled from external sources (e.g., WRDS) is stored. Most of the time, a data codebook won’t be necessary, as the external sources will provide documentation.

- generated: This folder contains derivative data generated by running the code within the repo. A codebook might be useful if you expect users to work with the data without going through your code, but it is not strictly required. Specifically, this folder holds filtered data after the pulling step, which is ready for further analysis.

The pulled and generated folders include a .gitignore file to prevent the accidental committing of generated data.
