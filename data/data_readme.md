This `data_readme` file briefly describes the data used for the ARG Project. This structure helps maintain a clean and organized data repository, ensuring that data can be easily accessed, understood, and replicated.

These directories are meant to be organized as follows:
- external: Store data that you obtained from outside the repo, meaning that
  they cannot be regenerated by the code contained in the repo. These data
  should be committed. If you external data is too large consider to store 
  them in a database or in an external data repository. Github LFS might also be an alternative. The data stored in the external repository should always be accommodated by a data codebook.
> [!NOTE]
> This folder remains empty for this project, as there is no external data directly uploaded to the folder. In fact, the data is pulled from WRDS into `data/pulled` and prepared (filtrated) into `data/generated` folder.

- pulled: This is where you store data that your repo code pulls from external
  sources (WRDS). Most of the time a data codebook won't be necessary as the external sources will provide documentation.

- generated: This is derivative data that are generated by running the code 
  within the repo. A codebook might be nice if you expect users to work with
  the data without working through your code but not strictly require. Specifically, this folder holds filtrated data after the pulling step which is ready for the further analysis implementation step.

In the folders 'pulled' and 'generated' a .gitignore prevents accidental committing of generated data.  
  
Obviously, you can use more descriptive folder names as you see fit. But we would encourage you to always separate external data from code generated data and to only commit data that cannot be code generated. An exception could be made on cases where generating the data takes substantial time and the resulting dataset is relatively small.
