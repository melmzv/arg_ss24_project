# Motivation

## Understanding Systematic Differences in Earnings Management across Countries

- The paper of @Leuz_2003 focuses on the relationship between investor protection and earnings management.
- Investor protection plays a crucial role in limiting the extent of earnings management by reducing the opportunities for managers to manipulate earnings.
- Analyzing the relationship between EM and investor protection across different countries provides insights into how legal and institutional frameworks impact financial reporting practices.
- Earnings management (EM) measures reflect the extent to which managers manipulate financial reports to meet certain objectives, such as meeting earnings targets or influencing stock prices.

## Project Objective

- The primary objective is to demonstrate a reproducible and collaborative research workflow by calculating and analyzing EM measures across different countries.
- The study aims to replicate and extend the findings of @Leuz_2003, exploring the relationship between EM and investor protection using Worldscope datasets for the time range 1990 to 1999.
- The analysis provides insights into the levels of earnings management across countries, comparing them with the original findings of Leuz, Nanda, and Wysocki (2003).

## Project Relevance

- Understanding EM trends across countries aids in assessing global financial transparency.
- Promotes transparency and reproducibility in empirical accounting research.

# Research Design

- Data sourced from the Worldscope Database (1990-1999) July 2024 version.
- Replication includes calculation of **four earnings management measures**:
  1. Earnings smoothing using accruals (EM1)
  2. Correlation between changes in accruals and cash flows (EM2)
  3. Magnitude of accruals (EM3)
  4. Ratio of small profits to small losses (EM4)

# Assumptions

- **Database Version**: Analysis uses the July 2024 Worldscope data, which may differ from the November 2000 version due to updates and restatements.
- **Key Terms**: Earnings management (EM) and investor protection defined as per @Leuz_2003 for consistency.
- **Handling Negative Values**: Negative values in key metrics (e.g., operating income) were included to capture the full scope of EM activities.
- **Variable Selection**: Chose specific Worldscope variables (e.g., item1151 over item4051) based on best practices; differences may affect results.
- **Currency Consistency**: EM measures are based on scaled variables; currency consistency ensures comparability across countries.

### Discretionary Accruals ##delete

- Are used in tons of papers
- As measurement constructs for almost everything
  - Earnings Management
  - Earnings Quality
  - Audit Quality
  - Management Quality
- But how do they look like?


### Data - Replication Steps 

Step 1: Pulling the Data and Managing the Databases

Step 2: Data Preparation

+  To verify the robustness of descriptive statistics before the main replication, Table 1 from Leuz et al. was replicated, yielding results that closely align with the original study:
```{python}
#| label: table_1 
#| echo: false
#| output: asis

print(prep_latex_table(
    results['table_1'],
    caption='Replicated table - Descriptive statistics: Number of firm-year observations per country',
    label='tab:table_1'
))
```


### Conclusion

- Significant differences in earnings management practices across countries.
- Strong alignment with original findings in Leuz, Nanda, and Wysocki (2003).
- **Future Work**: Repository can be cloned or forked for further analysis.
